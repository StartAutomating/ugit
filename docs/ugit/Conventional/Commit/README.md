## ugit.Conventional.Commit


Conventional Commits are a useful way to organize your commit messages in Git.

To learn more about them, visit:

ugit makes them a little easier to work with.

In ugit, `git commit` supports a virtual parameter `-Type`.

You can tab thru any conventional commit types until you find the right one.
